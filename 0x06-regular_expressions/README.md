# 0x06. Regular expression

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are a powerful tool in computer science for pattern matching in strings. They are sequences of characters that form a search pattern, and can be used for string manipulation tasks such as searching, replacing, or splitting text.

For example, the regular expression `a.b` can match any string containing an "a", any character, and then a "b", such as "acb", "a2b", or "a$b".

Regular expressions can get quite complex, with special characters and sequences that have specific meanings, such as `*` for zero or more of the preceding element, `+` for one or more, and `?` for zero or one.

## Background Context

For this project, regular expression were built using Oniguruma, a regular expression library that which is used by Ruby by default.
