# 0x0B. SSH

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication between a client and a server over an unsecured network. It provides strong password and public key authentication, secure data communications, and data integrity. It's commonly used to log into remote machines and execute commands, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports and X11 connections. It's widely used by network administrators for managing systems and applications remotely, allowing them to log into another computer over a network, execute commands and move files from one computer to another.
