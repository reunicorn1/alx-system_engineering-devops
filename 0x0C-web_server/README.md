# 0x0C. Web server

A web server is a computer system that hosts websites and web applications on the internet. It processes incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols.
The primary function of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web pages to clients. The communication between client and server takes place using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents, which may include images, style sheets, and scripts in addition to the text content.
Web servers often come as part of a larger package of internet- and intranet-related programs for serving email, downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files, and building and publishing web pages. Examples of web servers include Apache, and NGINX.
