HTTP Request-Response Cycle: This is a process that happens when you try to access a webpage. Your browser (the client) sends an HTTP request to a server. The server processes this request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes the content of the webpage you want to access.
URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is essentially the address of a specific webpage or file on the internet. It usually contains the protocol (http or https), the domain name, and the path to the specific resource.
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's computer by the web browser while browsing a website. They are used to remember information about the user, such as login information, so that the server can provide a personalized experience when the user revisits the website.
