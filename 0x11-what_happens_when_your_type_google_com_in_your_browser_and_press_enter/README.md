# 0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

When you type "google.com" into your browser and press Enter, several things happen:
Domain Name System (DNS) Lookup: Your browser asks a DNS server for the IP address associated with "google.com". The DNS server responds with the IP address.
TCP/IP Connection: Your computer uses the IP address to establish a TCP/IP connection with the server hosting "google.com".
HTTP Request: Your browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server asking for the webpage associated with "google.com".
Server Response: The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the webpage.
Rendering the Page: Your browser interprets the received files and renders the webpage on your screen.
