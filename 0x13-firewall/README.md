# 0x13. Firewall

A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the Internet. Firewalls can be hardware, software, or a combination of both. They are a fundamental part of a comprehensive security framework for your network.
