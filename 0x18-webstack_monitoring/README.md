# 0x18. Webstack monitoring

“You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure”
Web stack monitoring involves observing and managing the performance of all the different components that make up a web application stack. This can include the front-end (client-side) components like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as the back-end (server-side) components like the web server, application server, and database server.
Monitoring these components can help you ensure that your web application is running smoothly and efficiently. It can also help you identify and troubleshoot any performance issues or bottlenecks.
